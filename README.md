1. THE CAR GAME 

This was the Final Project for my Computer Graphics course. It is programmed in C++ and implemented for an OpenGL application. Each model in the game is created from scratch, and acts as a 3D racing game that checks for collisions for every obstacle and also keeps track of your score until you get to the finish line.
